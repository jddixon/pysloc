this is the third line                          SLOC 1
this is the fourth // ending with a comment     SLOC 2
// this is the fifth 
and this is my very generous 6th line           SLOC 3

I see five source lines in this 32-line file    SLOC 5

/* This is a nested comment

One level down ...

/* The nested bit 

Two levels down ...

*/

We are still in a comment here at one level down

Zero depth, so not a comment.                    SLOC 6

/* /* /* oh hello */ */ */

/* A more
/* elaborate
/* depth three
*/ comment
*/ for you
*/

Freedom is precious.                            SLOC 7
