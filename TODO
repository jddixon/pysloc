    * suspect deduping not working

    * differentiate count totals by language -- introduce map from
        short lang name to (LOC, SLOC, TSLOC) totals tuple
2015-04-04
    * countLinesGeneric, countLinesPython should honor the line
        continuation character (backslash at end of line) - but
        how exactly?

2015-04-03 
    * uncomment
        TQUOTE = '"""'
        in pyTripleTester and get testPyTripleQuote.py working
    * standard output should be in the form
        LANG MMM/NNN/%nn.nT
        where LANG is the language code (abbrev), MMM the number of 
        lines of code, NNN source lines of code, and %nn.n the 
        percentage of SLOC which are test code (TSLOC)
    * should add . to names list by default (that has been the          * DONE
        behavior until now)                                             * DONE
    * add -L/--mainLang option

2015-04-01 [from snosloc/TODO]
    * -v should produce a sorted list                                   * DONE
    * add langMap, map of known languages (abbrev -> langName)          * DONE
    * add ext2lang, map guessing language from file extension
        - one language is 'notCode'
        - support at least python and snobol                            * DONE
    * add notCodeFiles set, list of file names which don't contain code
        (COPYING, README and such)
    * add command line option -L/--languges for csv list of languages
        (abbrev) to be counted; default = count all
    * integrate [snoSloc into] existing pySloc
    * output is langCount, a map, abbrev->(LOC, SLOC, TSLOC), where
        TSLOC is SLOC for tests
    * assume can use the same counter for Java and Go
    * the perils of Perl: www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=100344 
    * need generic counter                                              * DONE
        - don't count blank lines or those beginning with spaces*       * DONE
            followed by hash ('#')                                      * DONE
        - applied by default to anything on the command line
            * if file lang unknown, use 'gen' for generic

2015-02-16
    * triple-quoted strings (such as """...""") should be included in   * DONE
        the count                                                       * DONE
    * need more elaborate testing, especially of triple quoting         * DONE
    * handle pathelogical cases 
        - SQUOTEd TQUOTE: '"""' or 'like """ this'
        - DQUOTED TQUOTE: "this is """an example"""" (??)

    * -X switch exists and exRE is calculated -- but it's never used!   * FIXED

2012-10-24
    * need to drop getargs(), switch to current package [argparse]      * DONE
    * should accept wildcards as 'other' names                          * SKIP 
    * should accept directories as 'other' names as well                * DONE
        - so just drop the -i option and default to otherNames=['.']    * DONE
    * need to filter out duplicates: pySloc setup.py currently counts   * DONE
        setup.py twice                                                  * DONE
        - so we hash each file and only process if it has not           * DONE
            already been counted                                        * DONE
