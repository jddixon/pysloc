    * uncomment
        TQUOTE = '"""'
        in pyTripleTester and get testPyTripleQuote.py working
    * standard output should be in the form
        LANG MMM/NNN/%nn.nT
        where LANG is the language code (abbrev), MMM the number of 
        lines of code, NNN source lines of code, and %nn.n the 
        percentage of SLOC which are test code (TSLOC)

    * triple-quoted strings (such as """...""") should be included in   * DONE
        the count                                                       * DONE
    * need more elaborate testing, especially of triple quoting
    * handle pathelogical cases 
        - SQUOTEd TQUOTE: '"""' or 'like """ this'
        - DQUOTED TQUOTE: "this is """an example"""

    * -X switch exists and exRE is calculated -- but it's never used!

    * need to drop getargs(), switch to current package
    * should accept wildcards as 'other' names 
    * should accept directories as 'other' names as well
        - so just drop the -i option and default to otherNames=['.']
    * need to filter out duplicates: pySloc setup.py currently counts
        setup.py twice
        - so we hash each file and only process if it has not 
            already been counted
