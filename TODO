    * sudo pip3 install beautifulsoup4                                  * DONE

    * add simple counter that just counts lines, call the lang 'txt'    * DONE
    * rename countLinesGeneric countLinesNotSharp                       * DONE
    * lang is 'not#'                                                    * DONE
    * add countLinesGeneric which has a pattern or regexp for whatever
        starts a comment line
    * option -C should take colon-separated list of langs as argument,  * DONE
        and then total only those languages; bare -S means total all    * DONE
        languages

2015-04-11
    * add language (abbrev) to -v output line                           * DONE

    * figure out how to differentiate C *.h from C++ *.h 
    * write commentsForJava and testJavaComments

2015-04-07
    * FIX: fusegen count includes lang None with a count of zero
    * FIX: markdown counts are dominated by html:6927/6695; dunno
        where the test counts come from!
    * FIX: xxxfs counts are from autogen.sh and ltmain.sh; nothing
        for *.c, *.h -- ie 
        - we need to ignore library and generated shell code 
        - we need to count Makefiles, *.ac, *.am
        - but ignore Makefile.in, other generated files
        - and we need to count C code
            * ah but in this case (a) *.inc and (b) all *.c/h is 
                generated code
    * FIX: notCodeDir() is not being used
    * commentsForOcaml needs to be longer

2015-04-06 (edited from -03)
    * uncomment
        TQUOTE = '"""'
        in commentsForPy and get testPyComments.py working

    * countLinesGeneric, countLinesPython should honor the line
        continuation character (backslash at end of line) - but
        how exactly?

    * add -L/--mainLang option                                          * DONE

2015-04-01 [from snosloc/TODO]
    * add ext2lang, map guessing language from file extension
        - one language is 'notCode'
    * add notCodeFiles set, list of file names which don't contain code
        (COPYING, README and such)
    * add command line option -L/--languges for csv list of languages
        (abbrev) to be counted; default = count all
    * integrate [snoSloc into] existing pySloc
    * output is langCount, a map, abbrev->(LOC, SLOC, TSLOC), where
        TSLOC is SLOC for tests
    * assume can use the same counter for Java and Go
    * the perils of Perl: www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=100344 
    * need generic counter                                              * DONE
        - applied by default to anything on the command line
